# Rain-Fall-Prediction
This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow using historical weather data. The model employs a Random Forest algorithm to analyze various meteorological features, such as temperature, humidity, and pressure. The target variable, RainTomorrow, indicates whether it will rain the following day.

## Description
This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data using a Random Forest algorithm. By analyzing various meteorological features, the model classifies the likelihood of rain for the following day.

## Aim
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts rainfall, helping in decision-making processes for agriculture, event planning, and other activities dependent on weather conditions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing to handle missing values and select relevant features.
- Implementation of the Random Forest algorithm for classification.
- Performance evaluation through metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries**: `caret`, `dplyr`

## Installation
1. Ensure you have R installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following commands in your R environment:
    ```R
    install.packages("caret")
    install.packages("dplyr")
    ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and required libraries.
2. Preprocess the data by converting the target variable to a factor and selecting relevant features.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train the Random Forest model using the training data.
5. Make predictions on the test dataset and evaluate the model's performance.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **85.28%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting rainfall based on the available meteorological data.
